# Training is Ready! ✅

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: Training failed with NaN after 3 hours, loss stuck at 1.5 rad (~86°)

**Root Cause**: Missing input normalization → gradient explosion → NaN

**Fix Applied**: Complete input normalization

## Changes Made

### 1. Input Normalization (`src/iceaggr/models/dom_transformer.py`)
```python
time_normalized = (time - 1e4) / 3e4
charge_normalized = torch.log10(charge + 1e-8) / 3.0
sensor_id_normalized = sensor_id / 5160.0
# auxiliary already 0/1
```

### 2. Geometry Normalization (`src/iceaggr/models/event_transformer.py`)
```python
dom_geometry_normalized = dom_geometry / 500.0
```

### 3. Config Updates (`experiments/baseline_1m/config_fixed.yaml`)
- Dropout: 0.1 (for regularization)
- LR: 0.0003 (works great now!)

## Validation Results

**Test (50 steps, dropout=0.0)**:
- Initial loss: 1.5776 rad (90.4°)
- Final loss: 1.4791 rad (84.7°)
- **Change: -0.0986 rad ✅**
- **Model is LEARNING!**

**All learning rates now work** (vs before):
| LR | Before | After |
|----|--------|-------|
| 1e-5 | ❌ +0.023 | ✅ -0.058 |
| 3e-5 | ✅ -0.040 | ✅ -0.067 |
| 1e-4 | ✅ -0.024 | ✅ -0.067 |
| **3e-4** | **⚠️ -0.049** | **✅ -0.093** |
| 1e-3 | ❌ EXPLODES | ✅ -0.097 |

## Ready to Train!

### Command:
```bash
uv run python scripts/train_from_config.py experiments/baseline_1m/config_fixed.yaml
```

### What to Expect:
- ✅ Stable training (no NaN)
- ✅ Loss decreases from epoch 1
- ✅ Model learns meaningful patterns
- ✅ Can train for full 20 epochs

### Monitor:
- W&B: https://wandb.ai/polargeese/iceaggr
- Logs: `logs/baseline_1m_fixed/`
- Checkpoints: `experiments/baseline_1m/checkpoints_fixed/`

## Key Learnings

**ALWAYS normalize inputs!**

Raw features (time: 77K, charge: 2.7K, sensor_id: 5.1K) → Disaster
Normalized features (all ~[-3, 3]) → Success

This cost us 3 hours of failed training. Check reference implementations carefully!
