# T2 First Pulse - OPTIMIZED for Performance
# Experiment: t2_optimized
#
# OPTIMIZATIONS APPLIED:
# 1. Batch size 128 → 1024 (8x larger, GPU usage is only 0.07GB!)
# 2. Multi-worker data loading (num_workers: 4)
# 3. Mixed precision training (AMP) for 2-3x speedup
# 4. Learning rate scaled for larger batch: 3e-4 → 8.5e-4 (sqrt scaling)
# 5. Gradient accumulation if needed
#
# EXPECTED SPEEDUP: ~16-20x faster (51 hours → 2-3 hours!)
