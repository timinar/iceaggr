# Notes

Design documentation for the iceaggr project.

## Contents

- [03_dom_aggregation_architecture.md](03_dom_aggregation_architecture.md) - Hierarchical transformer architecture design
- [04_flex_attention_benchmark_results.md](04_flex_attention_benchmark_results.md) - FlexAttention benchmarking results on real IceCube data

## Organization

- **notes/** (this directory) - Committed design documentation
- **personal_notes/** (gitignored) - Personal research notes, experiments, drafts

## Contributing

When writing design docs:
1. Keep them concise and actionable
2. Focus on decisions and rationale, not tutorials
3. Update with benchmark results when available
4. Reference implemented code rather than duplicating it

For rough drafts and experiments, use `personal_notes/` (not committed to git).
